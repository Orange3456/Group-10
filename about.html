                    Currently pursuing a Masters in Geo Informatics Engineering at Politecnico Di Milano, Italy.<br>
                    With a Bachelor of Engineering in Geo Informatics from Anna University, I have a solid foundation in geospatial data analysis, visualization, and management, using various GIS software and tools, such as ArcGIS Pro. I am passionate about applying my skills to real-world problems and challenges, especially in the fields of environment, disaster management, and urban planning.<br>
                    As a former Assistant System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, I worked on multiple projects involving cloud computing, data engineering, and software development, using AWS services and solutions. I obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, which validates my knowledge and skills in this domain. I gained valuable experience in working with diverse teams and clients, delivering quality results within deadlines, and contributing to the success and growth of the organization.
